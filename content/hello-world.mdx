Welcome to my blog! This is a hyper-minimal blog built with **Next.js**, **MDX**, and **cache components**.

When you update the MDX content, Vercel does not trigger a rebuild. Instead, GitHub sends a webhook to /api/revalidate to let the app know which posts were created, deleted, or modified. The webhook revalidates specific cache tags so users see the fresh content without a redeploy.

## Features

This blog includes:

- Clean, readable typography
- MDX support for rich content
- Cache components for selective revalidation
- Navigable component for smart prefetching
- Custom components

<Callout type="info">
This is a callout component! You can use it to highlight important information in your posts.
</Callout>

### Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

> This is a blockquote. Use it for important quotes or callouts.

That's all for now. Happy blogging!
