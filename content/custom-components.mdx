# Using Custom MDX Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to use React components directly in your content.

## Callouts

Use callouts to highlight different types of information:

<Callout type="info">
This is an informational callout. Perfect for tips and general information.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
This is a success callout. Great for highlighting positive outcomes or achievements.
</Callout>

## Adding Your Own Components

To add custom components, edit `components/mdx-components.tsx` and export your component. Then use it in any MDX file!

```typescript
export function MyComponent({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div className="my-custom-style">{children}</div>
}
```

Then in your MDX:

```mdx
<MyComponent>
  Your content here
</MyComponent>
```

It's that simple!
```
